# Netflix-Clone
## Live at https://netflix-clone-71dcc.web.app/

## Tech stack
- Used ReactJs to fetch movies data from tmdb API and displayed them in React components as similar as I could get to the original Netflix website.

## Future feautres I might add:
  - My own API that would allow users to create accounts, and have their own watching lists saved in a database.
  - Recommendation system using Machine Learning; to recommend movies or shows to users based on their watching list.
  - Streaming service; Actually saving videos for the shows/movies, and stream them in real time upon request.
